# IoT-quantile-Queries

This is the implementation of the experiment part of  our paper.

The part of  Greenwald-Khanna Algorithm is based on the   @[WladimirLivolis](https://github.com/WladimirLivolis/GreenwaldKhanna/commits?author=WladimirLivolis) 's work(https://github.com/WladimirLivolis/GreenwaldKhanna).

Some of the baseline's code was overlapped. It means you just need to change several lines of the code to make it work different.

The accurate estimation of the experiment  BaseStations  is the guarantee of  the  performance of our algorithm .(it means the source data (baseStations16.txt ,baseStations24.txt ,baseStations32.txt ) may only worked well on my computer. To get a better performance , it is recommended that  get the estimation on your machine).

The FinalTestSingle.java is the main class for Single Query.

The MultipleQuery2.java is the main class for concurrent Query.
