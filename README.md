## Introduction

This repository encapsulates the source code, datasets, and scripts for 
reproducing of our paper entitled 
"Efficient and Error-bounded Spatiotemporal Quantile Monitoring in Edge Computing Environments".

## Acknowledgements

- The module of GK (Greenwald-Khanna) Algorithm is 
based on the [implementation](https://github.com/WladimirLivolis/GreenwaldKhanna) 
by @[WladimirLivolis](https://github.com/WladimirLivolis/GreenwaldKhanna/commits?author=WladimirLivolis).

- The simulated data is generated by the [Generic IoT data simulator](https://github.com/IBA-Group-IT/IoT-data-simulator).

- The real mobility dataset is created from the 
[GeoLife trajectory project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367&from=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownloads%2Fb16d359d-d164-469e-9fd4-daa38f2b2e13%2F).

## Get Started

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

The code is implemented in Java 12, without external libraries used.

The code implementation should be executable on all platforms for which there exists a JVM.

It is suggested to import the project to the IntelliJ IDEA (or other alternative Java IDEs) and run the code from the console.

## Result Reproduction

### Our Testing Environment

***Note that we validate the efficiency results including maximum/average query latency and EBD time in
the above-mentioned testing environment. One with a different CPU and/or memory size should get 
the results with similar trends as reported in our paper.***
